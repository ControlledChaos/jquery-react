# React jQuery Plugin

React jQuery is a conditional (form) helper. In its basic form, it will show/hide an element based on compliance with a set of conditions (rules).

React strives to be: 

  1) **Functional** - it does what it says it does
  2) **Readable** - the naming is deliberately chosen to communicate exactly what it does
  3) **Adaptable** - creating custom rules or actions is easy
  
Example of setting up rules. 

    var IS = $.extend({}, $.fn.reactor.helpers); // don't really need this, but it makes the following lines easier to read
	  
    $('.cities')	
       	.reactIf('#zip', IS.Between(19100, 19400))
       	.reactIf('#zip', IS.NotBlank);
       		
    $('.philly_middle_to_low_income')
      	.reactIf('#income_2011', IS.LessThan(40000))
       	.reactIf('#cities_select', IS.EqualTo('philadelphia'));
       		
    $('.low_income_select_zips')
       	.reactIf('#income_2011', IS.LessThan(15000))
       	.reactIf('#zip', IS.BetweenSameLength(19000, 20000))
        .reactIf('#zip', IS.NotBlank);
       		
    $('.reactor').trigger('change.reactor'); // run all the conditions at the start
